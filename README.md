# 👋 Hi, I'm Edwin — Fullstack Software Engineer

I’m a full-stack JavaScript engineer who loves building clean, practical, real-world applications — especially tools that improve daily life, faith, and personal discipline. I work primarily with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and I’m focused on producing software that feels fast, reliable, and intentional.

🚀 What I’m Building Right Now:

OmniLife Command Center — A personal SaaS-style dashboard
React · Node · PostgreSQL · Tailwind · JWT
A unified control center for productivity, spiritual study, fitness, and daily tracking.

Bible & Wisdom Search Engine — Full-text scripture + wisdom lookup
Optimized for speed, clarity, and deeper understanding.

Iron Wolf Fitness Tracker — Performance analytics + burpee logging
Bringing discipline, data, and progression tracking into one place.

Scripture UI Library — Reusable React components for spiritual apps
Clean, extensible, and built for long-term maintainability.


🧠 Tech Stack & Tools:

Frontend: React 18, Tailwind, Redux
Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma
Mobile: React Native
Tools: Git, GitHub, Vite, Postman, Render, Vercel


📌 What I Care About as a Developer
- Writing code that’s simple, readable, and stable
- Building products that serve real needs — not trends
- Strong engineering habits: testing, version control, structure
- Owning the full lifecycle: design → build → deploy → iterate
- Learning continuously and shipping consistently
